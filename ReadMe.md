# S21 BRICK GAME

## Introduction

Welcome to my little project. In this case i created an interactive game with user input, physics, game levels and score saver. At first, the game will be easy for you, but be vigilant! The speed can change significantly quickly.

## Controls

The game is controlled by the arrows on the keyboard. You can also use a numpad.

To rotate figure use **r**;
To boost figure use **mouse wheel** or **shift + arrow down**;
To pause the game use **Spacebar**;
To quit the game use **Q**.
